The proposal here was to develop a game similar to  **Trivia**, a game show of questions and answers using React and Redux. The main features included:

- Simulate a user login page, and, in case this email is registered on [Gravata's](https://pt.gravatar.com/) website, show the user image;
-  Create a gameplay page, where the user can see the questions and options;
- Create a timer for the user to answer the question and in case he doesn't; show the right answer and advance to the next question;
- Create feedback's screen where the player can see his score and number of hits, as well as receive a customized feedback message;
- Create a ranking screen where multiple players can see their scores ranked;
- Create a configurations screen where the player can set some parameter of the game, such as difficulty, category and type of question;

- Create *Redux actions* on React applications;

- Create *dispatchers* on React apps;

- Connect Redux to React components;

- Create *Redux asynchronous actions* on a React app;
